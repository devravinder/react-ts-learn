Logical:-

1. flat an array 
   i=> [1,2,3,[4,5,[6,7]]]   o=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

2. find the indext at which the left sum & right sum has max diff
    ( conside index one in left side sum)

   i=> [4,5,1,2,3]    o=> 3
      

3. Pair Sum
   find the elements whose sum is equal to the given number
    i=> 8, [1,2,3,5,4]      o=> 3,5
    ii=> 9, [1,2,3,4]       o=> false

4. Middile element is linked list

6. Proper closing brackets
   i=> {[] []}   o=> true
   ii=>
